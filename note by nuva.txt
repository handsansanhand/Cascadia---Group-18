need to display wildlife tokens have not decided how to do it rigt now 
currently converting @fmega698 and @handsansanhand code to my own so it can be used with the gui have the wildlife tokens coverted need to look over the rest and see wha i can implement 


What we have so far on the gui
randomise tiles
tile pixel drawings for fiull tiles ie 100%
still need to add some more mixed tiles ie the 50% ones 
we have the name entry using text fields 
we have a randomiser to choose who goes when 
we have a score functions that scores based on the number of non uniues images
in the board 
the sxcore feature is semi broken right now 
so we need to try sort that out
we have a turn counter that counts how many tiles have been placed on the board
we still have the bug that needzs to be fixed where a user can place multiple tiles in one turn wothout getting punished we can fix this whith a while loop and a bollean conditions
we have 4 unique bard generated boards generated for each player we could fix this by using a game loop but i dont know how to do this
